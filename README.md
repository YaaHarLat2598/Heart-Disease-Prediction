# Heart-Disease-Prediction
Heart disease cases are escalating rapidly, making early prediction and diagnosis increasingly critical. Effective prediction models can significantly enhance preventive measures and treatment outcomes. We have developed a heart disease prediction system that utilises the patient's medical history to ascertain the probability of heart  disease.
Our approach involves deploying different machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM),Gradient Boosting and Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) to predict and classify patients at risk of heart disease. These algorithms were chosen for their ability to handle classification tasks effectively and provide high accuracy. The system is designed to optimise prediction accuracy, particularly focusing on improving the identification of individuals at risk of a heart attack.This improvement in prediction accuracy alleviates some of the pressures faced by healthcare professionals in diagnosing heart disease, ensuring more reliable and timely predictions.
By implementing this heart disease prediction system, we aim to enhance medical care quality and reduce associated costs. The system provides significant insights that aid in the accurate prediction of heart disease in patients. The model is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook (.pynb) format, facilitating ease of use and integration into healthcare systems. This project underscores the potential of machine learning in transforming heart disease prediction and improving patient outcomes.

# Introduction
Machine learning is a powerful tool that helps us find useful information in data that we might not see otherwise. It's a growing field that's becoming more important every day, especially in healthcare. Machine learning includes various methods to analyze data and make predictions. In our project, we use machine learning to predict heart disease, which can save lives by catching the disease early. Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are heart-related conditions that are very common today. These conditions include coronary artery disease, heart attacks, heart failure, and arrhythmias. According to the World Health Organization, CVDs cause about 17.9 million deaths worldwide each year, making them the leading cause of death among adults . This is why predicting heart disease early is so crucial. Early diagnosis and treatment can significantly reduce the risk of severe complications and improve the quality of life for patients. Our Heart Disease Prediction System (HDPS) helps identify people who are likely to develop heart
disease by analyzing their medical history. By doing this, we can help doctors diagnose the disease earlier with fewer tests and provide effective treatments sooner. Traditional methods of diagnosing heart disease can be invasive, expensive, and time-consuming. Using machine learning can streamline the process, making it more efficient and accessible. We use a dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which includes 14 medical attributes such as age, gender, chest pain type, and fasting blood sugar levels . We analyze this data using six different

# Machine learning models:
# ● Logistic Regression: A model that predicts the likelihood of an outcome based on input data.
# ● Decision Tree Classifier: A model that uses a tree-like structure to make decisions based on the data.
# ● Random Forest Classifier: An advanced model that uses many decision trees to improve prediction accuracy. This model achieved the highest accuracy of 98% in our project.
# ● Support Vector Machine (SVM): A model that finds the best boundary to separate different classes in the data.
# ● Gradient Boosting Classifier: A model that builds a series of simple models to gradually improve prediction accuracy.
# ● Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) Neural Network: A type of artificial neural network that can model complex relationships in the data.

By using these models, we can classify patients based on their risk of developing heart disease. The Random Forest Classifier, in particular, proved to be the most effective, with an accuracy of 98%. This high accuracy means our system can help doctors make better predictions and decisions, ultimately improving patient care and reducing healthcare costs.

The risk factors for heart disease include high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, physical exercises , and few other details related to heart disease . By incorporating these factors into our prediction models, we can provide more accurate assessments of a patient's risk. This allows for earlier interventions and personalised treatment plans, which can prevent the progression of heart disease and improve patient outcomes.

Our project shows how machine learning can transform heart disease prediction, making it more accurate and efficient.
